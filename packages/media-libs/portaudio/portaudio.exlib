SUMMARY="PortAudio - portable cross-platform Audio API"
DESCRIPTION="
PortAudio is a free, cross platform, open-source, audio I/O library.  It lets you write simple audio
programs in 'C' that will compile and run on many platforms including Windows, Macintosh (8,9,X),
Unix (OSS), SGI, and BeOS. PortAudio is intended to promote the exchange of audio synthesis software
between developers on different platforms.

PortAudio provides a very simple API for recording and/or playing sound using a simple callback
function.  Example programs are included that synthesize sine waves and pink noise, perform fuzz
distortion on a guitar, list available audio devices, etc.
