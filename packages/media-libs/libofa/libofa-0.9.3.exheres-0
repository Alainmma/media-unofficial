SUMMARY="Open-source audio fingerprint by MusicIP"
DESCRIPTION="
MusicDNS is an acoustic fingerprinting service and a software development kit
provided by MusicIP. MusicDNS is used by MusicIP Mixer, MusicBrainz Picard, and
Jaikoz. According to MusicIP, the fingerprint database contains over 22 million
fingerprints as of August, 2006. It should be noted that MusicDNS has nothing to
do with domain name system (DNS).
The fingerprinting client library that looks up and identifies audio files based
on existing fingerprints is called libofa. While the client library is open
source and dual-licensed under the GPL as well as APL, the code for performing
initial music analysis and submitting new fingerprints to the MusicDNS database
is proprietary as the database also contains data for style similarity analysis
for use in MusicIP Mixer.
The MusicDNS client library works by first generating an acoustic fingerprint of
the analyzed audio file. This acoustic fingerprint is then looked up from the
MusicDNS web service. If a close enough match is found to an existing
fingerprint, the service returns an identifier called a PUID (short for Portable
Unique IDentifier) that unambiguously identifies the matching fingerprint. These
identifiers can be used by third parties (such as MusicBrainz) to relate
information to the identified audio file. PUIDs are fully qualified UUIDs and do
not include any acoustic information.
